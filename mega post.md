### Esperanto Keyboards, all systems go!
So, the biggest headache I'm seeing so far is being able to type Esperanto letters. Funny that when Zamenhof published his first book about Esperanto in 1887, he had no trouble typing his characters on his typewriter and couldn't imagine that technology would evolve to the point where it wouldn't be possible to type them easily.

Luckily, the New Zealand Esperanto Association has compiled a handy list of Esperanto keyboards for a wide variety of modern systems. Also note that even though Esperanto isn't available yet for mobile apps, you should still be able to access the course from your mobile browser!

**Update** We now support the x-system in our course! It won't convert as you type, but you can submit a sentence with the x-system and if it will be marked correct, it will not be marked as a typo. YAY!

### Esperanto Culture
Esperanto is distinct from most other languages in that its culture does not originate in a particular location. There is even the concept of Esperantio (literally: Esperantoland), which refers to everywhere in the world where Esperanto is currently being used.

#### Eventoj

There's an Esperanto event happening somewhere in the world every day. The Universala Kongreso is the biggest event where thousands of Esperanto speakers meet each year. However, it is usually better to wait until you've reached an advanced level of Esperanto to attend this event. Such a large event is indeed impressive, but it's also easy to get lost in the crowd as a beginner.

If you are 30 or younger, the Internacia Junulara Kongreso or Junulara E-Semajno are especially welcoming. Both have interesting lectures during the day and lively evening programs with concerts, dancing, beer and tea (in the gufujo, literally: “owl room,” a chill-out room). [See this list of Esperanto events](http://www.eventoj.hu/kalendaro.htm)

#### Muziko

Many Esperanto singers and bands play everything from folk to hip hop to hard core! Popular artists include:

* Dolchamar (rock/hip hop)
* Inicialoj DC (electronic)
* jOmO (folk/rock)
* Jonny M (raggae)
* Ĵomart kaj Nataŝa (folk)
* Kajto (folk)
* Persone (rock)

Muzaiko is a 24-hour online Esperanto radio station. Its music selection is quite diverse, so if you don't like the song currently playing, just wait a few minutes and you'll probably like the next!

#### Literaturo

Due to Esperanto’s flexible structure, many authors are inspired to write in this language. This flexibility allows poets and novelists a unique medium for sharing their deepest thoughts with an international audience. The avid Esperanto reader has no lack of material given the thousands of books published all over the world.

Along with a rich body of original Esperanto literature, translations have the distinct advantage of typically being translated by a native speaker of the source language. A native language translator has a better chance of capturing all the nuances of the original text in their translations.

#### Unikaj vortoj en Esperanto

There are also three words which are unique to Esperanto:

krokodili to speak one's native language when Esperanto is more appropriate. The idea is that when you're in an international Esperanto environment, it is considered inappropriate to speak your native language, since everyone can understand Esperanto, but not your native language.

aligatori to speak one’s non-native national language when Esperanto is more appropriate. Also be aware of the aligatorejo (literally: alligator place): a language-practicing session where you may speak any language except for your native language or Esperanto.

kabei to leave the Esperanto movement. This was named after Kabe (Kazimierz Bein) who was a prolific Esperanto writer and then suddenly left the Esperanto community in 1911.

#### Historio

The initiator of Esperanto, L. L. Zamenhof, was born in 1859 and grew up in Białystok (then Russia, now Poland). He saw many ethnicities living together: Poles, Belarusians, Russians, Jews, Germans, Tatars, Lithuanians, etc. Many conflicts arose from the lack of a common language, so he decided to take matters in his own hands by creating an easy-to-learn language, so everyone would be able to speak with each other.

After over a decade of work, in 1887, he released his first book, now known as Unua Libro in Russian. He later published this same book in other languages like Polish, French, German and English. Many people started learning and using Esperanto, which caused it to evolve naturally through international correspondence and chance meetings.

This all culminated in the first large Esperanto meeting called the Universala Kongreso (UK) in Boulogne-sur-Mer, France in 1905. Here 688 people came together to discover that Esperanto really works. They were equally surprised to discover that by the end of the week, they were speaking with a neutral Esperanto accent! A few years later in 1908, the Universala Esperanto-Asocio was founded, later becoming responsible for running the Universala Kongreso.

#### Nuntempe

Esperanto is used in over 120 countries around the world. Through Pasporta Servo, Esperanto speakers stay with hosts in over 90 countries. Esperanto also has a very active online presence, which can be seen on various sites around the Internet:

* Wikipedia (200,000 Esperanto articles)
* Google (search and translate work in Esperanto)
* Facebook (groups and official Esperanto translation)
* China Radio International (daily news in Esperanto)

Enjoy being part of this growing and truly international community!

Behind the scenes: This was the Tips & Notes we planned to release for the Esperanto Culture bonus skill. Due to technical issues, we can't currently release our bonus skills, but we hope these will be solved soon.

### When to use the -n

Thanks to a very helpful member of the Duolingo Esperanto Learners Group on Facebook, we are pleased to present the following useful summary:

When to use -n:

1. When the noun is the direct object: “Mi amas vin”, I love you.

2. When an adjective is describing the direct object: “Li ŝatas manĝi verdajn pomojn”, He likes to eat green apples.

3. When there is motion towards the noun: “La infano saltas sur la liton”, The child jumps onto the bed (compare “La infano saltas sur la lito”, the child was already on the bed and is jumping on it).

4. When expressing a duration of time: “La kapo doloris min la tutan tagon”, My head hurt the whole day.

5. When expressing length, quantities, price, distance and measures: “La ŝtofo estas 2 metrojn longa”, The fabric is 2 metres long; “La domo kostas multan monon”, The house costs a lot of money; “Ili marŝis dudek kilometrojn”, They walked twenty kilometres.

6. For greetings, thanks, wishes, apologies, and other similar expressions: “Saluton”, “bonan tagon”, “pardonon”, “bonan apetiton”, "gratulon", “dankon”, etc. These are shortened forms of a longer phrase: “Mi donas al vi dankon", “Mi deziras al vi bonan tagon”.

When NOT to use -n:

1. When the noun is the subject

2. Directly after “esti” or “fariĝi”

3. On “la”: “Ŝi verŝas teon en la tason” (NOT “Ŝi verŝas teon en lan tason”)

4. On numbers that are not nouns: “Ili havas du hundojn” (NOT “Ili havas dun hundojn)

5. When saying the name of the person you are talking to: “Mi amas vin, paĉjo” (NOT “Mi amas vin, paĉjon”)

NEVER use -n after: al, ĉe, da, de, dum, el, ĝis, kun, laŭ, per, por, pro, pri.
