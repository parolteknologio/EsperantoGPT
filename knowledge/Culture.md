# Esperanto culture

Esperanto culture refers to the shared cultural experience of the Esperantujo, or Esperanto-speaking community. Despite being a constructed language, Esperanto has a history dating back to the late 19th century, and shared socio-cultural norms have developed among its speakers. Some of these can be traced back to the initial ideas of the language's creator, Ludwig Zamenhof, including the theory that a global second language would foster international communication. Others have developed over time, as the language has allowed different national and linguistic cultures to blend together. Some Esperanto speakers have also researched the language's ideologies.

Esperanto culture also includes art, literature, and music, as well as international celebrations and cultural exchanges such as the Pasporta Servo.

## Native speakers

Native Esperanto speakers are people who have acquired Esperanto as one of their native languages. As of 1996, there were 350 or so attested cases of families with native Esperanto speakers. Estimates from associations indicate that there are currently around 1,000 Esperanto-speaking families, involving perhaps 2,000 children. In all known cases, speakers are natively multilingual, being raised in both Esperanto and either the local national language or the native language of their parents. In all but a handful of cases, it was the father who used Esperanto with the child. In the majority of such families, the parents had the same native language, though in many the parents had different native languages, and only Esperanto in common.

## Zamenhof Day

On December 15 (L. L. Zamenhof's birthday), Esperanto speakers around the world celebrate Zamenhof Day, sometimes called Book Day. It's a common goal to have a book written in Esperanto published on or by that day, as Zamenhof was a strong advocate of the idea that in order to spread Esperanto around the world, its speakers need to create a large body of literature.

The poem La Espero is the Esperanto anthem, and most Esperanto speakers know the lyrics of the anthem by heart. It is often sung at conventions. Whether or not one enjoys the lyrics, the song is something that ties all Esperanto speakers together — as it has been around since Esperanto's early days. The tune of La Espero is known to most Esperanto speakers, and is a general tradition. The very short poem Ho, mia kor' (Zamenhof, 1887) and the longer La vojo (Zamenhof, 1896) are also very famous and often quoted in whole or in part; some distychs of La vojo, in particular, have become proverbial (e.g. Eĉ guto malgranda, konstante frapante, traboros la monton granitan “Even a small drop, by constantly hitting, will pierce the mountain of granite” as a metaphor for unyielding perseverance).

# Pasporta Servo

The Pasporta Servo (English: Passport Service) is a hospitality exchange service available both online and in print that lists people in Esperanto culture who are willing to offer free homestays to speakers of Esperanto. It is maintained by the World Esperanto Youth Organization (TEJO). The platform is a gift economy; hosts are not allowed to charge for lodging. Guests using the service are encouraged to speak only Esperanto with their hosts.

## History

In 1966, psychologist Rubén Feldman González started the Programo Pasporto, a lodging service for Esperanto speakers, in Argentina.

In 1974, the Pasporta Servo directory was first published.

In August 2008, the directory was first published online.

# Esperanto events

There's an Esperanto event happening somewhere in the world every day. There are congresses, festivals, local groups, online events, Esperanto bike tours and much more.

The Universala Kongreso is the biggest event where thousands of Esperanto speakers meet each year. However, it is usually better to wait until you've reached an advanced level of Esperanto to attend this event. Such a large event is indeed impressive, but it's also easy to get lost in the crowd as a beginner.

If you are 30 or younger, the Internacia Junulara Kongreso or Junulara E-Semajno are especially welcoming. Both have interesting lectures during the day and lively evening programs with concerts, dancing, beer and tea (in the gufujo, literally: “owl room,” a chill-out room).

# Esperanto Literature

Due to Esperanto’s flexible structure, many authors are inspired to write in this language. This flexibility allows poets and novelists a unique medium for sharing their deepest thoughts with an international audience. The avid Esperanto reader has no lack of material given the thousands of books published all over the world.

Along with a rich body of original Esperanto literature, translations have the distinct advantage of typically being translated by a native speaker of the source language. A native language translator has a better chance of capturing all the nuances of the original text in their translations.

Literature in the Esperanto language began before the first official publication in Esperanto in 1887: the language's creator, L. L. Zamenhof, translated poetry and prose into the language as he was developing it as a test of its completeness and expressiveness, and published several translations and a short original poem as an appendix to the first book on the language, Unua Libro. Other early speakers wrote poetry, stories, and essays in the language; Henri Vallienne was the first to write novels in Esperanto. The first female Esperanto novelist was Edith Alleyne Sinnotte with her book Lilio published in 1918. Except for a handful of poems, most of the literature from Esperanto's first two decades is now regarded as of historical interest only.

Between the two World Wars, several new poets and novelists published their first works, including several recognized as the first to produce work of outstanding quality in the still-young language: Julio Baghy, Eŭgeno Miĥalski, Kálmán Kalocsay, Heinrich Luyken, and Jean Forge.

Modern authors include Claude Piron and William Auld, who was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature, Sten Johansson, Trevor Steele, Miguel Fernández , Julia Sigmund, Sen Rodin, Eugène de Zilah, Liven Dek , Manuel de Seabra, Baldur Ragnarsson, Jorge Camacho, Victor Sadler, Edwin de Kock , Mao Zifu , Benoît Philippe and others.

Esperanto has seen a solid production of material in braille since the work of the blind Russian Esperantist Vasili Eroshenko, who wrote and taught in Japan and China in the 1910s and 1920s, and Harold Brown wrote several modern plays in Esperanto.

The largest Esperanto book service at the Universal Esperanto Association offers around 4,000 books in its catalog. About 130 novels have been published originally in Esperanto. Two major literary magazines: Literatura Foiro, and Beletra Almanako, are published regularly; some other magazines, such as Monato, also publish fiction.

The most comprehensive guide to the literature of the language is Geoffrey Sutton's Concise Encyclopedia of the Original Literature of Esperanto, published under the auspices of the Esperanto-speaking Writers' Association by Mondial.
