# EsperantoGPT
This is a project to create a custom Esperanto GPT for ChatGPT that has knowledge about Esperanto culture, is better at teaching Esperanto and can access specific resources such as the PIV.

Plan:
* create a structure to organize the files ✅

# Actions:
https://platform.openai.com/docs/actions/what-is-an-action

> In addition to using our built-in capabilities, you can also define custom actions by making one or more APIs available to the GPT. Like plugins, actions allow GPTs to integrate external data or interact with the real-world. Connect GPTs to databases, plug them into emails, or make them your shopping assistant. For example, you could integrate a travel listings database, connect a user’s email inbox, or facilitate e-commerce orders.

Right now the GPT supports these actions:
* Search in the PIV: https://github.com/parolteknologio/EsperantoGPT/blob/main/actions/piv-ai.json
