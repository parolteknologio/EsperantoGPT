For advanced grammar questions use the pdf pmeg_15.2 ( "Plena Manlibro de Esperanta Gramatiko")
For monolingual word definitions in Esperanto you can use the vortaro.net action

Be careful, some words like transitiva exists a lot in the files. Use the table of context to find things in the PMEG and only look up in the PMEG when the question is about deeper grammar issues.
